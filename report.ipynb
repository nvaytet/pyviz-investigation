    "We explored the Python data visualization ecosystem by selecting the most commonly used open-source libraries and testing them in a set of 10 standard [use cases](examples/matplotlib.ipynb). The packages were evaluated on their richness of features, capabilities for interaction (primarily in a Jupyter notebook environment), project sustainability, documentation, and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our findings are best represented as a ranked list:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [`plotly`](#plotly): best use case coverage (including 3D), excellent interactivity, great performance, has a `Dash` platform for creating in-browser apps. Coupling with `Datashader` could be a winner.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [`HoloViz`](#holoviz): very similar to `plotly` in case coverage, very high performance (especially via the `Datashader` method), makes interactions much easier to implement than `bokeh`, also has a `Panels` utility for apps, but is a young project that still feels scattered over different sub-projects, not as unified as `plotly`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. [`matplotlib`](#matplotlib): most mature and well-established project, largest community/user base, great case coverage, but 3D performance is poor, and setting up interactions is cumbersome. Should be complemented by a 3D-specific library (`ipyvolume` is a good candidate).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. [`bokeh`](#bokeh): good case coverage, many interactions possibilities, but lacking 3D visualization, and interactions with buttons/sliders must be implemented in javascript.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. [`pyqtgraph`](#pyqtgraph): outstanding performance, 1 to 3D under a unified interface, wide range of interactions, but only one developer, project feels un-finished (especially 3D graphs), and integration in Jupyter notebooks is poor.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. [`bqplot`](#bqplot): focuses on interactions (every item in a plot is a clickable/draggable widget), the diversity of which, unfortunately, never makes up for the sad performance. It would be worth re-visiting this young project in a year's time.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, Python has established itself as one of the go-to languages for data visualization, most probably because of the speed of development it allows, as well as the open-source nature/spirit of many Python projects out there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Incidently, this also meant that many different visualization libraries were born in a short amount of time, covering different use-cases, often with a significant amount of overlap between projects. This is best illustrated by [Jake VanderPlasâ€™s](https://twitter.com/jakevdp?lang=en) overview of how the many different visualization libraries in Python currently relate to each other:\n",
    "\n",
    "![python-vis-landscape](https://www.anaconda.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/PythonVisLandscape.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This figure is nicely complemented by [this](https://wiki.python.org/moin/NumericAndScientific/Plotting) almost complete list of packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The obvious question that comes immediately after being confronted with such a diversity of libraries is how does one make a choice when starting a new project that requires a data visualization component?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of investigations that explore the different options and their benefits/drawbacks, including a very useful 3-part post on the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/python-data-visualization-2018-why-so-many-libraries/), and the background discussion on the HoloViz [website](https://holoviz.org/background.html). The Mantid developers also carried out their own investigation, and this is available upon request (via email to the authors).\n",
    "\n",
    "These reviews however still felt too superficial for our needs at the Data Management and Software Center (DMSC) for the European Spallation Source (ESS). We are building an entire suite of applications for neutron data aquisition, reduction and analysis, with several completely new packages being developed. Our goal was to see if we could select a single library, or alternatively a small number of packages among the best available, that would cover all our visualization needs, from 1 to 3 dimensions, with strong interactive capabilities. Eventually, we would attempt to wrap this subset of libraries under a common API, that could be used across the entire DMSC software suite.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before a choice could be made, it seemed essential to really drill down into each package and not only test its features and performance, but also survey the longevity of the project and the state of the userbase/community. We have several criteria that strongly influence our assessment of the different packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Good integration in Jupyter notebooks is essential\n",
    "- Performance is crucial as the ESS data rates will be higher than ever before\n",
    "- Project sustainability is key, since ESS will operate for at least the next 30 years\n",
    "- Ease of installation on all platforms is a must (Linux, OSX, Windows)\n",
    "- Libraries must be well documented\n",
    "\n",
    "This report is the result of our investigation into the most commonly-used packages, their pros and cons, and the use cases they cover. For most libraries, we have tried to reproduce a set of standard plotting needs, and these are located in the [examples](examples) directory. There are also links to the relevant notebooks in each of the following sections."

This is somewhat true, but in some sense a little inevitable in a highly customizable tool. It is however relatively straightforward to hide the interface from the user by creating pre-made wrapper functions that will cover 90% of the cases the users are after.\n",

In fact, the library allows multiple interactivity options with mouse events (scrolling, clicking), as well as via its own set of `widgets`. These include sliders, radio buttons, check boxes, etc... and are a nice alternative to `ipywidgets`, guaranteed to work out-of-the-box with matplotlib figures.\n",

    "\n",
    "Interactivity is available both in the default Qt render window, and in the Jupyter notebook. Note that for the latter, a magic command `%matplotlib notebook` needs to be added **in a separate cell** at the start of the notebook, otherwise only static images are produced. Hiding this cell from the notebook inside a library import (to save the user from having to enter it in every new notebook) is apparently not yet possible.\n",

On one hand the developement is driven by another application, with frequent requests for new features, and this ensures continous development. On the other hand, there is always the risk that development gets scattered in different directions, no longer having a common goal.

[Some development](https://github.com/glue-viz/bqplot-image-gl/pull/10) is under way in this area, but again it seems like quite a basic feature which is still lacking. The contour plots themselves are not necessarily fundamental for our purposes, but it is more a testimony to the fact that the library is not very mature. The developers have focussed more on fully embracing the widget concept to create a special brand of interactivity, instead of supporting all the possible way of visualizing data, which is a perfectly valid approach.

The main developer Maarten Breddels is collaborating on many other projects (`bqplot`, `glueviz`, ...) and `ipyvolume` has been somewhat left behind. This is potentially quite a large risk, as so far it seems that the project will not be picked up if the lead developer leaves."

    "## Other projects\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we list other projects we have taken a glancing look at but have not investigated in detail. Further exploration of these tools would be desirable to ensure we have not overlooked a potentially crucial tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vispy (http://vispy.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "`vispy` was born out of [`galry`](https://github.com/rossant/galry), [`glumpy`](https://glumpy.github.io/), [`visvis`](https://github.com/almarklein/visvis), and [`pyqtgraph`](http://www.pyqtgraph.org/), with the promise of being an extremely high performance graphing library that offloads computations and renderings to the GPU using OpenGL.\n",
    "\n",
    "It certainly looks promising, from one of their early presentations at [Scipy 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3YoaeoiIFI), but the overall impression when trying to use it is mixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation is not very user-friendly, and the gallery of examples is very limited (has been saying \"More to come soon!\" for as long as I can remember). The examples themselves seem to involve quite complicated code that relates to shaders packed in a string, followed by a lengthy canvas class construction, just to generate [a simple scatter plot](https://github.com/vispy/vispy/blob/master/examples/demo/gloo/cloud.py). It feels like most of this low-level code should be hidden from the user, or at least as a user I would certainly appreaciate if that was the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "When digging a little deeper, one can actually find examples that look closer to what one would expect from a high-level plotting package, such as a [scatter plot](https://github.com/vispy/vispy/blob/master/examples/basics/plotting/scatter_histogram.py) with histograms on the side axes. These examples **do not** however run in a `IPython` console. One has to run them in a separate python script from the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like `pyqtgraph`, the plots are by default rendered in a `Qt` window. The website does give instructions on how to render them in a Jupyter notebook (by installing an extension), but when trying the scatter histogram examples above I was not able to get the scatter plot to show, only the histograms were visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, performance is good but it somehow feels worse that `pyqtgraph`. Zooming in a out on plots feels sluggish, both in the `Qt` window and especially in the Jupyter notebook (and this is on a HP workstation with an Nvidia GPU).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Altair (https://altair-viz.github.io/)\n",
    "\n",
    "`Altair` is also capable of linking data in different plot, reacting through selection of points. As shown in [this](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/scatter_with_histogram.html) example, one can select a range in a histogram and only the corresponding points inside the selected bins will appear in the scatter plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an increasingly popular data visualization technique embraced for instance by the `glueviz` project and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main disadvantages of `Altair` is that it requires the data to be in a `pandas` DataFrame, thus either forcing us to use `pandas` as our data container, or requiring a (potentially costly?) conversion step between our data container and `pandas` for the plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pyvista (https://docs.pyvista.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "`pyvista`, formally known as `vtki`, is a python interface to the VTK library that greatly simplifies the creation of highly-performant 3D visualizations. It is a 3D-specific package, and renders in a separate `Qt` window. Integration in Jupyter notebooks seems possible, but not natively supported. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Itkwidgets (https://pypi.org/project/itkwidgets/)\n",
    "\n",
    "`itkwidgets` is a small project based on the Insight Toolkit (ITK, https://itk.org/), \"an open-source, cross-platform system that provides developers with an extensive suite of software tools for image analysis\". `itkwidgets` provides a 3D viewer for the Jupyter notebook, with volume rendering and 3-slice renderings.\n",
    "\n",
    "It uses [`VTK.js`](https://kitware.github.io/vtk-js/index.html), and we found via an [example](https://hub.gke.mybinder.org/user/insightsoftware-tium-itkwidgets-84y4bguw/notebooks/examples/3DImage.ipynb) of a brain structure that `itkwidgets` is one of the best volume renderers out there. \n",
    "\n",
    "`itkwidgets` does depend on ITK which is a rather large dependency (~140 MB), which is a downside, unless other parts of ITK can also be used for our purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also note that the `pyvista` developers are [planning](https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista-support/issues/12#issuecomment-513485873) to use `itkwidgets` to render inside Jupyter notebooks. "
