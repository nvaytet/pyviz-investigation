On one hand the developement is driven by another application, with frequent requests for new features, and this ensures continous development. On the other hand, there is always the risk that development gets scattered in different directions, no longer having a common goal. This can very well lead to parts of the project becoming disconnected, developing at different speeds, and utlimately break apart.

[Some development](https://github.com/glue-viz/bqplot-image-gl/pull/10) is under way in this area, but again it seems like quite a basic feature which is still lacking. The contour plots themselves are not necessarily fundamental for our purposes, but it is more a testimony to the fact that the library is not very mature. The developers have focussed more on fully embracing the widget concept to create a special brand of interactivity, instead of supporting all the possible way of visualizing data, which is a perfectly valid approach. I would simply recommend coming back to `bqplot` in a year's time to see how they have progressed."

It feels like most of this low-level code should be hidden from the user, or at least as a user I would certainly appreaciate if that was the case.\n",
