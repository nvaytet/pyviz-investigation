    "`matplotlib` is by far the most popular and widely used package in the scientific data visualization community. It is an old and very mature project, and yet still sees very active development.\n",
    "It is the go-to library for creating publishable vector graphics pdf figures in articles, and specialises in 2D plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is either already installed on most systems, or very easy to install on all platforms. Its strength is on high-quality static figures, and is behind other projects on the interactivity side of things.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has some 3D capabilities through the `Axes3D`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see what `matplotlib` can do, a good place to go is [its sample plots page](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/sample_plots.html).\n",

    "\n",
    "When talking about `matplotlib`, a common complaint that arises is that the API is a little difficult to get around, especially for a non-experienced user/programmer. This is somewhat true, but in some sense a little inevitable in a highly customizable tool. It is however relatively straightforward to hide the interface from the user by creating pre-made wrapper functions that will cover 90% of the cases the users are after.\n",

    "### Interactivity\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common misconception is that interactivity is virtually not supported in `matplotlib`. In fact, the library allows multiple interactivity options with mouse events (scrolling, clicking), as well as via its own set of `widgets`. These include sliders, radio buttons, check boxes, etc... and are a nice alternative to `ipywidgets`, guaranteed to work out-of-the-box with matplotlib figures.\n",

    "\n",
    "Interactivity is available both in the default Qt render window, and in the Jupyter notebook. Note that for the latter, a magic command `%matplotlib notebook` needs to be added **in a separate cell** at the start of the notebook, otherwise only static images are produced. Hiding this cell from the notebook inside a library import (to save the user from having to enter it in every new notebook) is apparently not yet possible. "

    "`pyqtgraph` is only being developed by one person, Luke Campagnola, and development has been slow for the last ~2 years. There are 200+ issues open on github and 100 PRs, including some that are several years old. While it seems many different people are creating PRs, all of them seem to fail the CI tests. However, they are still getting merged regardless\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use in Jupyter has limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "When using `pyqtgraph` in a Jupyter notebook, one cannot embed the plots in the notebook, a separate `Qt` window has to be spawned. This causes problems if running on a remote machine, as well as making it difficult to remember which plot corresponded to which cell in a lengthy notebook.\n",

    "```Python\n",
    "app = QtGui.QApplication([])\n",
    "QtGui.QApplication.exec_()\n",
    "```\n",
    "method, the cell in the notebook is locked and everything below can only be executed once the plot window has been killed, making the use of Jupyter rather pointless. This can however be alleviated via the use of the magic command\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "%gui qt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3D visualization is not fully developed\n",
    "\n",
    "While representing scatter plots, surfaces, etc... works very well in 3D, it feels like development was never fully completed. For instance, there are no annotated axes for 3D plots. Only a mesh that serves as a point of reference for the eye is available, with no tick marks nor any labels/annotations. While it may not be too difficult to add, it is not obvious development would be swift, judging by the number of open PRs."
